The rank is achieved by forward query and backward requery. While the "**_rank_a_b" denotes the forward query ranking results and the  "**_rank_b_b" denotes the backward requery ranking results. Specially:

The "kissme_rank_**" is achieved with the method in [1];
The "sdc_rank_**" is achieved with the method in [2];
The "sdalf_rank_**" is achieved with the method in [3];
The "ldfv_rank_**" is achieved with the method in [4];
